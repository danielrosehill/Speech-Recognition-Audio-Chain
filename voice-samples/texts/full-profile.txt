“When sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as tiny prisms and form a rainbow.
The rainbow divides white light into many beautiful colors, arching high above and fading beyond the horizon.
Some say there’s treasure waiting where the rainbow ends, though no one ever finds it.

There once was an old storyteller who loved to describe those rainbows. He dressed simply, spoke with warmth, and seemed to carry the calm patience of time.
His voice rose and fell with rhythm, like waves meeting the shore.

Now, I’ll shift my tone slightly — this is my natural speaking voice.
This is a quieter, softer tone.
And this one is louder, more confident and clear.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
She sells seashells by the seashore.

These sentences include nearly every sound in the English language.
I’ll slow my pace to demonstrate clarity… and now I’ll speak faster to show agility.

Next, a few neutral descriptive sentences for analysis:
The lamp shone brightly in the quiet room.
A small bird perched gently on the window ledge.
Music drifted through the hall with echoes of calm.

Finally, I’ll change my pitch — this is higher… and this is lower.
I’ll end by speaking naturally, as I would in a relaxed conversation.

This passage is intended for analyzing tone, clarity, pitch, and rhythm across different styles of natural speech
